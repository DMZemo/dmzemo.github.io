#event #Iox #TheFall 

The Once Great City in the Clouds, [[The City of Iox]], fell to the ground and was instantly decimated. It was the machinations and schemes of Dagon, a beholder crime lord who had been working in the underground of Iox for decades. He was not caught before his plan came to fruition. And it came to fruition after Jacob Brith, the man who fell through time, appeared in the underground ancient portal of Adventportavis. In response to the discovery of a mysterious stranger who claimed he was from the future, a Grand Summit was called with all [[The Links]] of Ra'el. The adventurer parties known as [[The GOATs]] as well as [[The A-Team]] were in attendance, as well as [[Waylan the Water Wizard]], [[Quaron]], and the one called [[Finnegan]].
