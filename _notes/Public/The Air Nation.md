The Air Nation was a great power on The Continent.
It had one capital metropolis, [[The City of Iox]], the City in the Clouds.
Iox was held aloft by ancient magics and only a scant few knew how it was stabilized miles above the ground.
Dagon, a beholder crime lord who spread his influence and eyes throughout Iox, eventually discovered the solitary mechanism that kept Iox flying in the sky. 
Dagon severed the magic that kept the city airborne, and it came crashing down in what has become known as [[The Fall]].
