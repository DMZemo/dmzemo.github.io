The ruins of Old Iox are vast and gory. Bodies and some restless ghosts still haunt the remains of the great city that fell. Not all were granted a proper burial or any at all. In the center of the Ruins is a statue, much newer, only about 5 years of dust on it. **[[The Statue of St. Michael]]**. One who survived the fall of Iox, and got a thousand or so to safety with him. He fought his way through a crowd of aberrations at the skyport, commandeered  a Dragonship, and loaded on as many innocents as he could while still being able to fly away. Many of those survivors were the founders of New Iox. Michael died as he lived, opening the first free tavern in New Iox before passing in his sleep one morning.
