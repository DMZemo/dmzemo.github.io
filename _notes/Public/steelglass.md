One of the many lost arts of Iox, Steelglass has the hardness of steel with the transparency of glass. Once used for windows and greenhouses and skylights in [[Old Iox]]. Now recovered and repurposed slivers of steelglass typically end up as uncommon art objects or as particularly sharp constructed blades.
