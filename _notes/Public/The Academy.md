The premiere place of learning, academia, and excellence in all of Ra'el. One of [[The Seven Wonders of The Continent]], The Academy taught Fighters, Paladins, Clerics, Wizards, Sorcerers, Bards, Monks, and Artificers how to be the very best in their class. Experts from everywhere, artifacts from the middle of nowhere, and anybody who's anybody either went to The Academy, visited The Academy, or dreamed of some day making it to The Academy. The creme de la creme of intellectuals, socialites, guild artisans, and philosophers rubbed elbows at The Academy. It now is a smoldering ruin in the center of The Plains.
