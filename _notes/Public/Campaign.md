#main #mainquest

100 years after [[The Fall]].

A [[steelglass]] [[skylight]] has opened up in the ruins of [[Old Iox]], the old capital of [[The Air Nation]]. The opening has granted access below to the Library Tower of The Academy. None know how or why it opened now, 100 years and counting since the city became a buried ruin.

The skylight is inexplicably intact, with piles of stone and rubble all around it, and when the skylight opened, the powerful mechanisms within pushed open the skylight and displaced the debris and dirt on either side, exposing a newly accessible hole in the ground about 60 feet wide.

The "hole" is the shaft of what has been identified as [[Ragathan's Tower]], the Library Tower of [[The Academy]].
