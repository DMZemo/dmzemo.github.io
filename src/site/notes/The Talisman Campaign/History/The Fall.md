#event #Iox #TheFall 
##### "If any one city were to fall, then all would be lost, given enough time." ~[[The Talisman Campaign/NPCs/Guntherglint Brindswallow Gemeyer\|Guntherglint Brindswallow Gemeyer]]'s [[The Talisman Campaign/History/The Four States of Matter\|The Four States of Matter]].

The Once Great City in the Clouds, [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/The City of Iox\|The City of Iox]], fell to the ground and was instantly decimated. It was the machinations and schemes of Dagon, a beholder crime lord who had been working in the underground of Iox for decades. He was not caught before his plan came to fruition. And it came to fruition after Jacob Brith, the man who fell through time, appeared in the underground ancient portal of Adventportavis. In response to the discovery of a mysterious stranger who claimed he was from the future, a Grand Summit was called with all [[The Links\|The Links]] of Ra'el. The adventurer parties known as [[The GOATs\|The GOATs]] as well as [[The A-Team\|The A-Team]] were in attendance, as well as [[Waylan the Water Wizard\|Waylan the Water Wizard]], [[The Talisman Campaign/NPCs/Quaron\|Quaron]], and the one called [[The Talisman Campaign/NPCs/Finnegan\|Finnegan]].
