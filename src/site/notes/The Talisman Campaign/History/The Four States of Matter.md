A brief Essay by [[The Talisman Campaign/NPCs/Guntherglint Brindswallow Gemeyer\|Guntherglint Brindswallow Gemeyer]]

First there was nothing, then there was something. We all know there to be emanations from the origin, from zero, how else would we see with eyes and view this page. The sensate world is populated by Four states of matter, readily observable. Solid, Fire, Liquid, Gas. These are the same as The Four Elements, [[Earth\|Earth]], [[Fire\|Fire]], [[Water\|Water]], [[Air\|Air]]. So there are 4 cities of Earth, 3 of Fire, Two of Water, One of Air. In following the cosmic order of creation where none becomes one becomes two and so on, the very fabric of our reality seems to be informed and enforced by the invisible hand of [[O'drahn\|O'drahn]] and whatever they came from.

Knowing this, we also can ascertain that all are connected, that the cities and the fields, the mountains and the valleys, all are one and effect the affect of the other. So when one is out of balance, all are out of balance. If any one city were to fall, then all would be lost, given enough time. 

We must study all the elements and all the states of matter in order to align ourselves with the order of the cosmos and create magic from understanding the inner workings of the weave within ourselves.
