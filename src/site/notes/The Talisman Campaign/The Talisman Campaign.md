# The Talisman Campaign
![talisman_map.jpg](/img/user/The%20Talisman%20Campaign/talisman_map.jpg)

Fryday, September 1st, 2650. The 4th and final month of the Season of O'drahn (Summer).

[[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/New Iox\|New Iox]] is putting out a quest bounty for Adventurers.
[[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/Old Iox\|Old Iox]], the ruins of [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/The City of Iox\|The City of Iox]], the old capital of [[The Talisman Campaign/History/The Air Nation\|The Air Nation]], has a new ruins entrance that just opened up.

A [[The Talisman Campaign/Objects/steelglass\|steelglass]] [[The Talisman Campaign/Objects/skylight\|skylight]] has opened up in the ruins, revealing a way down below.
The opening has granted access to the Library Tower of [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/The Academy\|The Academy]]. None know how or why it opened now, 100 years after [[The Talisman Campaign/History/The Fall\|The Fall]].

The skylight is inexplicably intact, with piles of stone and rubble all around it, and when the skylight opened, the powerful mechanisms within pushed open the skylight and displaced the debris and dirt on either side, exposing a newly accessible hole in the ground about 60 feet wide.

The "hole" is the shaft of what has been identified as [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/Ragathan's Tower\|Ragathan's Tower]], the Library Tower of [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/The Academy\|The Academy]].
