100 years after [[The Talisman Campaign/History/The Fall\|The Fall]].

A [[The Talisman Campaign/Objects/steelglass\|steelglass]] [[The Talisman Campaign/Objects/skylight\|skylight]] has opened up in the ruins of [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/Old Iox\|Old Iox]], the old capital of [[The Talisman Campaign/History/The Air Nation\|The Air Nation]]. The opening has granted access below to the Library Tower of The Academy. None know how or why it opened now, 100 years and counting since the city became a buried ruin.

The skylight is inexplicably intact, with piles of stone and rubble all around it, and when the skylight opened, the powerful mechanisms within pushed open the skylight and displaced the debris and dirt on either side, exposing a newly accessible hole in the ground about 60 feet wide.

The "hole" is the shaft of what has been identified as [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/Ragathan's Tower\|Ragathan's Tower]], the Library Tower of [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/The Academy\|The Academy]]. 

Records have been able to found, miraculously, that show a rough sketch of the tower, a sketching by none other than [[Jakamin The Wandering Bard\|Jakamin The Wandering Bard]], and detail an elite tourists view of the entire tower, as Jakamin had access to ever floor. No security protocols or codes are put to pen, but Jakamin detailed 20 Levels of tower.
