100 years after [[The Talisman Campaign/History/The Fall\|The Fall]].

A [[The Talisman Campaign/Objects/steelglass\|steelglass]] [[The Talisman Campaign/Objects/skylight\|skylight]] has opened up in the ruins of [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/Old Iox\|Old Iox]], the old capital of [[The Talisman Campaign/History/The Air Nation\|The Air Nation]]. The opening has granted access below to the Library Tower of The Academy. None know how or why it opened now, 100 years and counting since the city became a buried ruin.

The skylight is inexplicably intact, with piles of stone and rubble all around it, and when the skylight opened, the powerful mechanisms within pushed open the skylight and displaced the debris and dirt on either side, exposing a newly accessible hole in the ground about 60 feet wide.

The "hole" is the shaft of what has been identified as [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/Ragathan's Tower\|Ragathan's Tower]], the Library Tower of [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/The Academy\|The Academy]].
