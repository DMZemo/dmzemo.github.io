![talisman of ultimate evil.jpeg](/img/user/The%20Talisman%20Campaign/Objects/talisman%20of%20ultimate%20evil.jpeg)
An infamous Artifact, said to still be within [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/The Academy\|The Academy]] ruins.

Crafted from an unknown metal, inlaid with steelglass that always resonates with a dim green glow.

It is said to be able to open a rift to the Abyss and draws unfortunate victims into it, never to return.

It has a number of myths and rumors about it, but the confirmed studies of it at the Academy led to the following observations:

The Talisman is always preternaturally cold, even if it is exposed to an Infernal Forge.

It can only be attuned by an Evil aligned creature. 

Creatures of Good or Neutral Alignment experience great pain even touching the artifact. Celestials are particularly affected and seem to have a vulnerability for the object's power.

Unbreakable. The item can’t be broken. Special means must be used to destroy it. It is said to have been stolen from the lost Temple of Fear. Finding the Temple of Fear or ancient lore about the temple may lead to a clue as to how to destroy it.

Wicked. When the bearer of the Talisman is presented with an opportunity to act in a selfish or malevolent way, the item compels the bearer’s to do so with formidable force.

Corrupt. Anyone attuned to the artifact destroys all holy water within 30 feet of themselves and extinguishes all non-magical flames.
