The Aldercrest Family

A lineage that stretches back to the illustrious days of Old Iox, the flying metropolis that once graced the skies with its splendor and magic. The rise of the Aldercrest noble house to power and status in Old Iox can be attributed to their mastery of ancient arts and their deep connection to the mystical forces that permeated the floating city.

The Aldercrest family distinguished themselves through their expertise in the arcane arts, particularly in the manipulation of elemental magic that powered the floating structures of Old Iox. They were renowned for their skill in crafting enchanted artifacts, imbuing them with the essence of the elemental planes to enhance their power and beauty.

As the city of Old Iox thrived on trade and innovation, the Aldercrest family played a pivotal role in the city's economy and politics. Their magical creations, from floating gardens to enchanted clockwork contraptions, captured the admiration of the city's elite and garnered them favor among the ruling class.

Furthermore, the Aldercrest family's commitment to preserving the ancient traditions and knowledge of Old Iox endeared them to the citizens, who saw them as stewards of the city's rich history and guardians of its secrets. Their patronage of the arts, education, and magical research further solidified their influence and status in the flying metropolis.

Through their mastery of magic, their contributions to the prosperity of Old Iox, and their dedication to preserving the city's heritage, the Aldercrest family rose to prominence as one of the most respected and powerful noble houses in the floating metropolis. Their legacy endured even after the fall of Old Iox, carried forward by generations who sought to uphold the honor and traditions of their esteemed lineage.
