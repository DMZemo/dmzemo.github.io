![Erma Portrait.png](/img/user/The%20Talisman%20Campaign/NPCs/Erma%20Portrait.png)
Erma, Link of Earth, Mother of The Forest.

Erma was, is, and shall be the leader of the Earth Nation. She is an ancient elf and few know her exact age. It is commonly held she is at least 600 years old, but any mention of her exact age is buried in the ruins of Old Iox.

Recent reports have paid particular attention to the fact that she has been allowing less and less visitors to Oolan with each passing year, and Jalisa Highwater from Sophtos reported at The Wave Pages that upon her last visit to The Earth Capital, Erma appeared to have barkskin permanently affixed to her forehead, as if ready for anything her numerous guards couldn't react to in time.
