Guntherglint Brindswallow Gemeyer was a gnomish scholar who taught at the Academy. He was known for always smelling of lavender, his love of brie, and his inscrutably undecipherable tomes on metaphysics and pataphysics. Required reading at The Tertiary Level of Academic learning, most students and readers of Gemeyer fall into one of three schools of thought about his writing. Many find him impossible to understand, some find him a peerless genius, while some find his writing to be merely a copious amount of word vomit to strangely say something stupidly obvious.
