## The Steelglass Skylight

Not everyone has the luxury of affording a Dragonship. Many more though can afford a ride on one, and in my opinion, it is the *only* way to enter The Academy. 

Sure you can walk into the Academy from the Verdant Plaza, walk past Cooper Street and pick up a chilidog from one of the cart vendors, and that IS wonderful.  But *nothing* beats descending from a world of clouds, landing atop a wizard's tower, all while riding in a massive flying boat made to look like a great wyrm.
