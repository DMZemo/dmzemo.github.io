# The Grand Hall of Naphae

Words aren't something I struggle with. But Naphae silenced me when I finally reached the base of Ragathan's Tower. The Grand Hall is a pedestrian name for it. I call it The Hall of Knowing. It knows your name. And it knows you struggle to name it in return. A feeling. A wind in your heart. The smell of an old book. The quiet of sunrise. The power of a crashing wave. 

Everywhere is a feast for the eyes. Imported woods, imported marble, all the finest that Ra'el has to offer. All condensed into the wealth of a great library the likes of which has never been witnessed before. Precious metals and gems (silver and diamonds mostly), mahogany tables, green-glass lamps, rows upon rows upon rows of bookshelves bursting at their seams with the weight of the knowledge they contain.
