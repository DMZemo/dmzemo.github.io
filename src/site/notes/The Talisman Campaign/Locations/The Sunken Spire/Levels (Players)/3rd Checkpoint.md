Security Checkpoint

Ioxian technologists perfected "The Triune Pillar", a security device able to dispel curses, nullify invisibility, and create a wall of force that forbids any magic items from passing through. A much needed precaution when shipments from Dragonships could potentially hide stowaways or dangerous items. Wouldn't want those undesirables entering a school full of novice practitioners. 

Being the social scientist that I am, I decided to put their security measures to the test. Secretly of course, but they'll thank me later. As soon as I crossed the threshold of the device standing ominously in a narrow corridor, my Bag of Holding was lifted gently off of my shoulders and slowly drifted upwards to an apertured concealed container within the middle pillar. A faint blue light pulsed through the device, and my bag then slowly drifted out of the compartment and to a guard below. The guard took a piece of parchment, scribbled on it with a short-quill, ripped it cleanly in two, and handed me one half with the number "42" written on it. The guard then placed my bag on a large rotating metal rack behind him. A magic item coat check. 

The scanner was apparently not able to notice or contain the legendary artifact I had in my possession on my person. Which was fortunate for me for I fully intended to use this tour opportunity to leave my small mark on the Academy. If you are reading this testimonial, perhaps you may be the first to discover the door I left ajar. If you work for The Academy, I would recommend increasing the weavic resonance of your Triune Pillars so that even legendary magic items are detected and contained. What good is a checkpoint that blocks butterknives but allows Black Razor?
