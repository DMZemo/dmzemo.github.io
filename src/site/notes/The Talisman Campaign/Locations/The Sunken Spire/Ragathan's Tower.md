[[The Talisman Campaign/NPCs/Ragathan\|Ragathan]]'s Tower.

Records of the floorplans have resurfaced, given recent need of them. A rough sketching of every floor was penned by none other than [[Jakamin The Wandering Bard\|Jakamin The Wandering Bard]], and he detailed an elite tourists view of the entire tower, with his exclusive access to every floor. No security protocols or codes are put to pen, but Jakamin detailed 20 Levels of Ragathan's Tower.
