New Iox is the growing city on the lake in the center of the plains, where Iox once flew directly overhead. Most of the architecture is scavenged materials from [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/Old Iox\|Old Iox]], bits of stone masonry, wood, and [[The Talisman Campaign/Objects/steelglass\|steelglass]] found amidst the ruins, repurposed to build a new city. 

Founded primarily by 3 farmer families that survived [[The Talisman Campaign/History/The Fall\|The Fall]] (due to their farms being groundside), the emblem of New Iox (before it was called that) are three yellow (for the Air Nation) sickles on a white stripe (white for rising up to fate) on a red background (red for the blood spilt in [[The Talisman Campaign/History/The Fall\|The Fall]]).
