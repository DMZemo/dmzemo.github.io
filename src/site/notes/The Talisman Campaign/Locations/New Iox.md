New Iox is the growing city on the lake in the center of the plains, where Iox once flew directly overhead. Most of the architecture is scavenged materials from [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/Old Iox\|Old Iox]], bits of stone masonry, wood, and [[The Talisman Campaign/Objects/steelglass\|steelglass]] found amidst the ruins, repurposed to build a new city. 

Founded primarily by 3 farmer families that survived [[The Talisman Campaign/History/The Fall\|The Fall]] (due to their farms being groundside), the emblem of New Iox (before it was called that) are three yellow (for the Air Nation) sickles on a white stripe (white for rising up to fate) on a red background (red for the blood spilt in [[The Talisman Campaign/History/The Fall\|The Fall]]).

$Fenfall Village District$: a picturesque district in the southwest part of the city. It is known for its cobblestone streets lined with quaint shops and cafes. The architecture here is a mix of stone and timber, giving the area a rustic charm. The village square is the heart of the district, bustling with activity as locals gather to socialize and trade goods.

$Greenbridge District$: a tranquil neighborhood located on the city's edge, surrounded by lush greenery and blooming gardens. The district is dotted with elegant manor houses and winding pathways that lead to secluded parks and ponds. The residents of Greenbridge take pride in their community's natural beauty and often host outdoor events and festivals.

$Southern Docks$: Situated on the shores of  Lake Isotem, the Southern Docks are a bustling hub of maritime activity. Fishing boats and cargo vessels dock here, unloading their goods at the bustling marketplace. The salty sea breeze mingles with the scent of fresh fish and spices, creating a vibrant and lively atmosphere.

$Golden Docks$: The Golden Docks are located along the river within the walled section of the city, where the wealthier residents reside. Here, opulent mansions and grand townhouses overlook the water, their facades adorned with intricate carvings and gilded details. The docks are lined with luxury yachts and private boats, symbolizing the prosperity of the city's elite.

$Northern Docks$: The Northern Docks cater to the city's affluent population seeking entertainment and leisure. This area features exclusive clubs, theaters, and high-end restaurants where the wealthy gather to socialize and enjoy the finer things in life. The architecture here is grand and imposing, reflecting the status and wealth of its inhabitants.

$Amberwood Road$: This road runs through the middle of the city, starting in Greenbridge and cutting through the bustling city center and ending in the northeast through the Fishdocks district. Lined with shops, cafes, and boutiques, Amberwood Road is a popular destination for both locals and tourists alike. The street is known for its vibrant atmosphere and diverse array of goods and services. Travelling merchants going to and from Oolan, Fomexet, and Sophtos all find their ways through the center of the continent here, where the Amberwood Road cuts through New Iox. 

$Fishdocks$: Located to the north and outside the city center, the Fishdocks is a vibrant district centered around a park courtyard circled by merchant shops and tourist traps. The smell of freshly caught fish fills the air as fishermen unload their daily hauls at the bustling marketplace. Visitors can sample local seafood delicacies and browse colorful stalls selling handmade crafts and souvenirs.

$City Center$: a bustling hub of activity and commerce. Here stands the grand castle that serves as the seat of power for the city's ruling council. Surrounding the castle are government buildings, marketplaces, and guild halls where merchants, artisans, and adventurers converge to conduct business and seek opportunities. The Castle is the beating heart of New Iox, where the city's past and future intersect and are commemorated with recovered pieces of the Ruins of [[The Talisman Campaign/Locations/Old Iox\|Old Iox]].
